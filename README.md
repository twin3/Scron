Scron is a light-weight JavaScript library providing scheduling functionality for calculating next run times and user-friendly description outputs based on an easy to write formula modelled on the Unix Cron system.
  
  
If you're looking for help with this library either integrating into your own project or are looking for assistance in understanding how to write a Scron formula, then please jump over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/twin3/Scron/wiki) which we are continuously improving to provide the best help we can achieve.
