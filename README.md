Scron is a light-weight JavaScript library providing scheduling functionality for calculating next run times, providing user-friendly next run descriptions, and run now callback functionality.
- [x] Replace your existing giant schedule capture form full of calendars and time inputs (each with their own annoying set of validation rules) with a single input field.
- [x] User friendly [Wiki](https://github.com/twin3/Scron/wiki) you can direct your users to in order to help them easily understand how to become a Scron pro
- [x] Run on your websites, servers or JS-based applications (needs to be ES6 compatible one way or another)
- [x] No additional dependencies! The project is entirely self contained!
- [x] Can be used just for its date-formatting functionality!
  
  
If you're looking for help with this library either integrating into your own project or are looking for assistance in understanding how to write a Scron formula, then please jump over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/twin3/Scron/wiki) which we are continuously improving to provide the best help we can achieve.
  
  
## Best Bits
- [x] Easy to enter formula (and very familiar for Cron users!)
- [x] Supports months and days of the week to be entered as words instead of integers (eg- "Monday" or "Mon")
- [x] Get the next run time as a Javascript Date object
- [x] Get the next run time as a user friendly description
- [x] Run now functionality directly in your Javascript
- [x] Supports milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, day of the month, month, day of the week, start date, end date and max run limits.
- [x] The package uses no additional dependencies, everything is within a single class making it more slimline and easier to maintain
- [x] Wiki written to help developers integrate and users use.
- [x] Built in date-to-string formatter
